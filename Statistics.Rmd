### Bayesian hierarchical nonlinear regression 
<font size="4">

1.  Manuscript in prep for PNAS. I combined data from regularly cycling, pregnant, and postpartum Tsimane and USA women to determine the association between different reproductive phases and degree of change from "baseline".<br />

2. Manuscript in prep for Science. I utilized Bayesian nonlinear regression models to estimate the population-specific effects of age on immune function, stratified by sex and female reproductive phase. <br />

3. A for-fun [side project](ProjectA.html){target="_blank"}, where I estimate the non-linear sex-specific effects of age on estradiol and testosterone levels and compare model outputs using brms versus mgcv packages. <br />

### Bayesian hierarchical linear regression
I utilized fully Bayesian hierarchical regression models to estimate and comparing the effects of trimester of pregnancy on immune status among Tsimane and USA women. Results published in [Immune function during pregnancy varies between ecologically dinstinct populations](https://academic.oup.com/emph/article/2020/1/114/5866980){target="_blank"}. <br />

### Classification using Bayesian binomial modeling
During summer 2021, I worked with my [Research Mentorship Program](https://summer.ucsb.edu/programs/research-mentorship-program/overview){target="_blank"} student Delaney Nordstrom to pull publically available data from the [Sex, Gender and COVID-19 project](https://globalhealth5050.org/the-sex-gender-and-covid-19-project/){target="_blank"} to determine if/how sex bias in COVID-19 mortality vared by country using Bayesian binomial models. <br />

### Logistic regression & Classification using ML
<font size="4">
A for-fun [machine learning project](ProjectB.html){target="_blank"} using logistic regression, Na√Øve Bayes, and *k*-Nearest neighbors to predict precipitation in Seattle. <br />
