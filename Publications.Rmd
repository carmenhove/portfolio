<font size="4"> Exploring the effects of time since delivery on female immune status in two ecologically distinct populations <br />

<font size="3">
Among placental mammals, female reproduction requires immunological trade-offs. During pregnancy the maternal body must successfully “host” a semi-allogeneic fetus, balancing immune competence with fetal tolerance. In humans, pregnancy is marked by downregulated cellular immunity and parasite response, preferential reliance on humoral immunity and “non-specific” defense, and coinciding shifts in disease susceptibility. In contrast, there is a scarcity of data on the immunological transition from pregnancy to the postpartum period, especially in non-industrialized populations, and little knowledge regarding the effects of breastfeeding behavior on postpartum immune function. Here, we estimate and compare the effects of month since delivery on total and differential leukocyte count and C-reactive protein concentration among the Tsimane, a natural fertility population experiencing high pathogen burden, and USA women, and (2) leverage variation in breastfeeding behavior within the USA population to estimate the effects of breastfeeding absence on postpartum immune status. We find that month since delivery exerts opposite effects on leukocyte differential compared to gestation, producing a unique period of immune modulation. These postpartum effects vary between populations, with Tsimane individuals exhibiting elevated total lymphocyte, eosinophil, and leukocyte counts after delivery and USA women exhibiting reduced neutrophil and monocyte counts, attenuated elevation in lymphocytes and eosinophils, and reduced total leukocyte count. Breastfeeding presence/absence was not a strong mediator of postpartum immune recovery among women in the USA. In sum, these results indicate that postpartum immune recovery follows population-specific reaction norms, with myriad implications for maternal health and disease after parturition. *(First author: study design, paper writing, all statistical analyses/figures/tables)*

<font size="4"> The relationship between infant feeding behavior and maternal inflammation status, physical health, and mental wellbeing <br />

<font size="3">
Due to the introduction of myriad breastfeeding alternatives (e.g., breast pumps, formula), the range of infant feeding behavior exhibited by mothers in the USA (and other post-industrial societies) is much wider than existed throughout most of human history. From an evolutionary perspective, replacement or heavy supplementation of at-the-nipple breastfeeding should be linked to dysregulated maternal immune recalibration, increased risk of sickness behavior (e.g., depression) and more symptoms of physical illness, due to evolutionary mismatch. On the other hand, mothers who sustain exclusive at-the-nipple breastfeeding for extended periods may experience diminishing returns on immune and health benefits due to increasing maternal-offspring conflict. In this context, moderating the degree of skin-to-skin breastfeeding may, to some degree and in a time-dependent manner, help mothers optimize their own immune status and health. We tested these predictions by collecting data on infant feeding behavior, biomarkers of inflammation, depressive symptoms, and self-reported physical health from a sample of postpartum mothers in the United States. We found that most mothers utilized both at-the-nipple breastfeeding and other infant feeding methods, especially pumping – highlighting the shifting landscape in infant feeding behavior. More infant feeding bouts involving at-the-nipple breastfeeding corresponded to fewer indicators of postpartum depression and better reported physical condition. Even in the relative absence of pathogen exposure, we also found that increased frequency of breastfeeding corresponded to a more tempered waking response in secretion rates of pro-inflammatory cytokines and C-reactive protein (a maker of acute systemic inflammation). As expected, these effects were most pronounced among mothers in the early postpartum period, when infant and maternal optimums are most likely to overlap. Taken together, these results point towards the benefits of at-the-nipple breastfeeding for maternal health outcomes and emphasizes the need for further research into the specific effects of evolutionarily novel alternatives (e.g., electric breast pumps) on maternal physiology. *(First author: study design, data collection, paper writing, all statistical analyses/figures/tables)*
