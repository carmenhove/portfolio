## Will Christmas in Seattle be drizzly or dry? 

## Data wrangling
For this project, I used daily weather data collected by [National Weather Service](https://w1.weather.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=sew) in December for the Seattle metro area (2000-2021).

After uploading the data, I found some squirrely problems that needed fixing.
