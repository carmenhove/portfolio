### Hi, I'm Carmen and I'm a quantitative research scientist
<img align="right" width="200" hspace = "10" src=face.jpg>
<font size="4"> I hold a BS in Biology, a PhD in Physical & Biological Anthropology, and have over 7 years of experience conducting end-to-end research on human health and disease (with an emphasis on reproductive health and immunology). I have demonstrated expertise in advanced statistics, cross-population study design, and bioanalytics. Check out the tabs above to see examples of my work.

On weekends, I can usually be found hiking in the Cascades, sewing quilts, climbing, or buried in a good book.
