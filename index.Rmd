### Hi, I'm Carmen and I'm a quantitative research scientist
<img align="right" width="200" hspace = "10" src=face.jpg>
<font size="4"> I have a BS in Biology, a PhD in Physical & Biological Anthropology, and over 7 years of experience conducting end-to-end research on human health and disease (with an emphasis on reproductive health and immunology). I have demonstrated expertise in [statistics](Statistics.html){target="_blank"}, [study design and execution](Projects.html){target="_blank"}, and [bioanalytics](Bioanalytics.html){target="_blank"}. Check out the tabs above to see examples of my work.

On weekends, I can usually be found hiking in the Cascades, sewing quilts, climbing, or with my nose buried in a good book.
