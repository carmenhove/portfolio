### Hi, my name is Carmen and I'm a **quantitative research scientist**

<font size="4 "> **My background**: With an BS in biology, a PhD in Biological Anthropology, and over 7 years of experience analyzing complex real-world datasets, my quantitative research skills are built on firm understanding of biological mechanisms and evolutionary context. Analytic experience includes linear and logistic regression, nonparametric regression, Bayesian hierarchical/multilevel models, Naive Bayes classification, and *k*-Nearest Neighbors cluster analysis. 

**This portfolio**: For examples of my work, please see projects under [Project A](https://carmenhove.github.io/portfolio/ProjectA.html) and [Project B](https://carmenhove.github.io/portfolio/ProjectB.html). For links to peer-reviewed papers I've co-authored, see [Publications](https://carmenhove.github.io/portfolio/Publications.html). If you'd like to get in touch, please don't hesitate to send me a message.
